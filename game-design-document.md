# WW2 Dogfight Arena - Game Design Document (GDD)

## Game Title
WW2 Dogfight Arena

## Overview
In "WW2 Dogfight Arena," the player controls a simple 3D plane in a minimalist WW2-inspired setting. The game focuses on the experience of flying a plane with realistic mechanics, starting from a runway and taking off into the sky. There’s no combat or complex objectives—just the joy of flight.

## Gameplay
- **Starting Point**: The player begins on a runway with the plane at rest (speed = 0).
- **Flight Mechanics**: 
  - The plane accelerates slowly and realistically using the *Forward* key.
  - Takeoff is only possible when the plane reaches a minimum speed (e.g., a simple threshold like 50 units).
  - Once airborne, the plane can pitch (up/down) and yaw (left/right) to maneuver.
- **Controls**: 
  - Refer to the Input section
- **Objective**: There is no specific goal—players are free to fly around, take off, and explore the simple 3D space.

## Visuals
- **Style**: Minimalist 3D with basic shapes and colors:
  - Plane: A simple triangular prism or cone (e.g., grey or green).
  - Runway: A flat rectangle (e.g., dark grey).
  - Sky: A gradient background (blue to light blue).
- **Environment**: No additional objects—just the runway and open sky to keep it simple.
- **Graphics**: Use basic 3D rendering (e.g., Three.js library) with solid colors and no textures.

## Input
- **Keyboard Controls**:
  - W or Z - Increase throttle (speed up)
  - S - Decrease throttle (slow down)
  - A or Q - Roll left
  - D - Roll right
  - Up Arrow - Pitch down (nose down to descend)
  - Down Arrow - Pitch up (nose up to climb)
  - Left Arrow - Yaw left
  - Right Arrow - Yaw right
- Designed for intuitive control, supporting both ZQSD (e.g., French keyboards) and WASD layouts.

## Target Platform
- **Web Browser**: The game will run in a web browser using JavaScript and a lightweight 3D library like Three.js.
- **Implementation Note**: Keep dependencies minimal (e.g., just Three.js) to ensure it’s beginner-friendly and quick to set up.

## Notes for Developers
- Focus on core mechanics: acceleration, takeoff, and basic flight controls.
- Use simple physics (e.g., speed increases linearly, pitch/yaw adjust rotation).
- Keep the scope small: no enemies, no scoring—just flying.
- Suggested tools: JavaScript, Three.js, and a basic HTML canvas.
